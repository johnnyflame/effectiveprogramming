def recursion(soFar):
    check so far + new piece and add it
    if (score so far is way worse than our best):
        go home
    if( the carpet is finished):
        check if its better than best so far
	
    for each part remaining in stock:
        recursion(so far+new piece)
	recursion(sofar+piece.reversed)
